# HPA_LIMS_Channel_Selector
An ImageJ plugin to keep only the best channel from two channels, acquired under the same settings but with different gain or exposure times. The plugin was originally developed as part of bridging software that enables to upload the OPERA imaging data of the HPA Sperm project to LIMS. This plugin processes such data only after they have been run through [HPA_Convert_OPERA_To_LIMS-OMETIF](https://github.com/CellProfiling/HPA_Convert_OPERA_To_LIMS-OMETIF). So this plugin uses the output folders from [HPA_Convert_OPERA_To_LIMS-OMETIF](https://github.com/CellProfiling/HPA_Convert_OPERA_To_LIMS-OMETIF) as input folders.
